# Kick VOD Progress Saver
A lightweight Chrome extension that automatically saves your VOD watch progress on **Kick.com**. Perfect for those who like to jump back into streams where they left off — without the hassle.

📌 Features
- ⏱ Automatic VOD Progress Saving
  
  Your current watch time is saved every few seconds while watching a VOD.

- 📆 Progress Stored for 1 Month
  
  All watch progress is automatically cleared after 30 days, keeping your data fresh and relevant.

- 📚 Watch History with Quick Access

  View a list of recently watched VODs and jump straight to the point where you left off.

🛠 How It Works
1. Open any VOD on Kick.com.

2. The extension monitors and stores your current timestamp.

3. Revisit the same VOD later — and you’ll pick up exactly where you left off.

4. You can also access a history view from the extension popup for quick navigation.

📥 Installation
> [!NOTE]  
  Due to the Chrome Extension Store being pay to publish I prefer to do local releases instead.  
1. **Download** .crx file from the releases.
2. **Open** `chrome://extensions`.
3. **Drag 'n Drop** downloaded file inside `chrome://extensions` page
4. **Done!**
